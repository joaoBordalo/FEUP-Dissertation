abstract = {In this work, we introduce an application autotuning framework to dynamically adapt applications in multicore architectures. In particular, the framework exploits design-time knowledge and multi-objective requirements expressed by the user, to drive the autotuning process at the runtime. It also exploits a monitoring infrastructure to get runtime feed-back and to adapt to external changing conditions. The intrusiveness of the autotuning framework in the application (in terms of refactoring and lines of code to be added) has been kept limited, also to minimize the integration cost. To assess the proposed framework, we carried out an experimental campaign to evaluate the overhead, the relevance of the described features and the efficiency of the framework. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},
